# Alfred OpenAI Workflow
This is just a small personal project that I started to get in touch with Python. It does by no means contain all OpenAI features.

#### Requirements:
```shell
brew install python3
```

#### Configuration:
Login to https://platform.openai.com/login to create an API Key and paste it into the "api_token" variable.

#### Usage:
```
gpt {query}
```
